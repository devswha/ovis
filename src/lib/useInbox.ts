/**
 * The shell's part in the mode's coming and going (App.tsx). The drawer is put away whenever the mode's shell stands,
 * however it came to (its entry, a Forward onto it); the way in closes the drawer, leaves a file open over the pane
 * behind (its viewer closes and its own entry stays under the mode's, so Back shows the pane with its file again),
 * enters the mode on its list, then where it may on the thread of the pane the app is on (below); and a mode with no
 * pane to show a thread of shows its list, once the page's link has landed. Left by any way
 * (Back to Ovis, the system Back), the mode takes its controls with it: a focus left nowhere goes to the classic
 * header's workspace-list toggle, as it does whenever the control that had it is gone (lib/focus.ts). A row's thread
 * takes the list off a phone's screen the same way, and the focus goes to the thread's Back.
 * The classic app and the mode are two views of one place: the conversation the app shows is the thread the mode
 * opens, and a thread opened in the mode is the pane the classic app shows (opening a row selects its pane; browsing
 * the list selects nothing). A draft and a chat's scroll belong to their pane (lib/composerDraft.ts, lib/chatScrollMemory.ts)
 * and come with it. So the way in opens the thread of the pane the app is on, when that pane has a row in the list
 * and already shows its chat (`here`): from 769px always, beside the list; on a phone, whose list is the mode's
 * screen, only when the mode was left on that same thread, and the list otherwise. A pane on its terminal enters on
 * the list, as one with no row does: opening its chat would change its lens and so release its pty's size, and the way
 * in sends nothing to any pane. It takes a reader's own two steps: the list first, as every way in does, and once the
 * list has covered the panes (they note what they hold as it covers them), the row's own opening of its pane (`open`),
 * which leaves the list by a history entry of its own, so the thread's Back is the list.
