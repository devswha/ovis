/**
 * The inbox mode's rail (from 769px): one narrow column of icon buttons at the far left of the mode's column, before
 * its list, holding the mode's ways out and around. It is a part of the column (App.tsx), cut out of the sidebar's
 * width (InboxMode.css), so the pane beside the column is where the classic shell has it. A window under 769px
 * draws no rail: its list keeps its own controls.
 *
 * At its top: the way out, the mode's one place and the command palette. Pushed to its foot: the agents that wait,
 * this device's alerts, Settings and the PCs. Each of them is here and nowhere else in the wide layout: the column
 * has no More and no foot. A button says what it is in its name and its tooltip; no label is drawn.
