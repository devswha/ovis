# ids, applies every patch and commits them there, so a clean `git status` in ./upstream means the
# tree is exactly "the pin plus our patches". A tree that is already that is left alone. A tree with
# edits of its own is never deleted: the script stops and says so.

# HC_TUI_REPO_OVERRIDE names another place to fetch the same commit from (a local clone, a mirror).
